# VBZLI

`VBZLI` is a small `rust` application that fetches the departures from a station in the VBZ public transport network and prints them to a pixel display. This project is heavily inspired by Stefan Schuellers work with (vbz-fahrgastinformation)[https://github.com/sschueller/vbz-fahrgastinformation]. Find his blog about it (here)[https://sschueller.github.io/posts/vbz-fahrgastinformation/].
